# Bus ETA Report for Hall 8 lab

This was made because it was annoying to take out phone and check how long until bus arrives and then run up when it was too late. With this, I can be constantly reminded when to leave the lab.

First project by Side project and Yapping sub team.

V1 Made by marco lk network and Nicholas did some shit to it

V2 Is a from-the-ground-up rewrite of the Javascript component used to update the ETA and clock by Planeson.
The clock is synced automatically from https://worldtimeapi.org/api/timezone/Asia/Hong_Kong
